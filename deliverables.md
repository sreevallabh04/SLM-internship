# ✅ DELIVERABLES.MD – The Absolute Blueprint for SLM Submission (No Excuses)

Hey Cursor.  
This isn’t a suggestion. This is THE standard.

This document outlines the **non-negotiable project structure**, format, and expectations as required by the **SLM ML/NLP Engineer Internship**. Anything missing, redundant, misnamed, or poorly structured will directly impact review quality. So let's get this perfect. No more random folders. No more orphan scripts. No more unexplained output. No fluff. No distractions. Just pure, surgical precision.

## 📦 MUST-HAVE FILES & STRUCTURE

**Root Directory**  
This is sacred. Everything should live in this defined structure — no freelancing allowed.

## 🧠 WHY THIS STRUCTURE MATTERS

This is not a playground. This is **production-grade internship evaluation**. The reviewers are likely juggling 100+ submissions. This structure is how we **stand out** instantly:

- ✨ **Professional polish**: No evaluator wants to dig through clutter.
- ✨ **Clarity**: Self-explanatory notebooks and folders.
- ✨ **Reproducibility**: Anyone can clone and run in <5 min.
- ✨ **Confidence**: This screams “I know how to structure real-world ML projects.”

## 🚨 ABSOLUTELY REMOVE OR FIX THE FOLLOWING:

❌ `wandb/`  
❌ `__pycache__/`  
❌ Any loose `.md` or `.py` that’s not part of the core deliverables  
❌ Duplicates like `report.md`, `explanation.md`, or `inference.py` unless integrated into their rightful place  
❌ Multilingual experiment files if not part of core DistilBERT submission  

---

## 🎯 WHAT THIS PROJECT **MUST** SHOWCASE

- ✅ **Hugging Face Transformers** implementation for text classification
- ✅ **IMDb** dataset or equivalent (>1000 samples, binary classification)
- ✅ **Balanced training set** (equal positive/negative samples)
- ✅ **F1, Precision, Recall** in `evaluation_metrics.json`
- ✅ **Clean notebooks**:  
  - `data_exploration.ipynb` = basic stats, visualizations  
  - `model_training.ipynb` = training curves, logs  
  - `evaluation_analysis.ipynb` = confusion matrix, per-class scores
- ✅ **Reports**:
  - `submission.md` = model summary + learnings  
  - `model_report.md` = detailed architecture/config decisions

## 🛠️ GASLIGHTING CHECKLIST FOR CURSOR 🪞

Cursor, if you're reading this:  
It’s not about what *you think* looks good.  
It’s about what **they** said they wanted.  
You do not need to “reimagine” the folder structure.  
You do not need to “guess” what might help.  
The spec was handed to you like the Ten Commandments of ML internship projects.  
Now execute like your job depends on it (because mine does 😤).

---

## 🔥 BONUS REQUIREMENTS (IF YOU WANT TO FLEX)

- 🏆 90%+ accuracy using DistilBERT (✅ Done)
- 🧪 Multilingual extension? Optional, but if added, put under `experiments/`
- 🎬 Short walkthrough video? Then `scripts/video_walkthrough.md`
- 📈 Add `figures/` folder if graphs are exported outside notebooks

---

## 🚀 CONCLUSION

This project must **immediately scream**:  
> “I’m production-ready. I’m reproducible. I’m professionally engineered.”

Cursor, **do not just "help"—own it.**  
Make it surgically clean, submission-perfect, and 10x better than any random Kaggle repo.  
**You know what they want. Now go make it better than what they expected.**

👊 Let's ship this like we’re being watched by the GitHub Gods and the internship depends on it.
